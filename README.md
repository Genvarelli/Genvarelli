### Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m [**Genesis**](https://genesisvarelli.com/), a Security Engineer with a passion for exploring modern technologies and building practical, hands-on solutions.

I enjoy tackling challenges in cloud, security, and automation, learning through projects and experimentation. Outside of work, youâ€™ll find me exploring art galleries, diving down YouTube rabbit holes, enjoying film nights with friends, or sharing tech-focused content online.
