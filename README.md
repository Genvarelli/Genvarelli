<h1>Hi there!</h1>

I’m [**Genesis**](https://genesisvarelli.com/), a Cybersecurity Analyst based in the Netherlands.

Passionate about building efficient, scalable security solutions that empower SOC teams to detect, respond, and stay ahead of threats.

Outside of work, you’ll find me wandering art galleries, diving into YouTube history rabbit holes, or having film nights with friends. I also enjoy creating & sharing tech-related content on social media.

#### Fun Facts:

* I don’t like coffee.
* Naruto is my favorite anime.
